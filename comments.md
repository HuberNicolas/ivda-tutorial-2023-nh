# Part 0
- Use the Default option (Vuetify for Vue 3) and press enter.
  - for me that is not very clear, since the default option seems to be the first option "Vuetify 2 - Configure Vue CLI (advanced)" or even "Vuetify 2 - Vue CLI (recommended)"

# Part 1
- There is no existing styling in App.vue
- Small typo (App.Vue instead of App.vue)
- Renaming "HelloWorld.vue" Component to "ConfigurationPanel.vue" did not break the code for me
- Color is not quite correct
